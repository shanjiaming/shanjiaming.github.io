# Experience

## Nubit
- **Role**: Smart Contract Security Researcher
- **Advisor**: Prof. Yu Feng
- **Date**: Jun 2025 -- Aug 2025
- **Description**: Developed **Sentinel**, a fully automated run-time defense system that neutralizes pending key on-chain exploits. Designed a conflict-driven optimization loop to synthesize counter-attack smart contracts under strict gas and safety constraints. Evaluated on 33 real-world DeFi exploits, preserving an estimated \$167M. The work resulted in the paper ``Adaptive Counter-Attack Synthesis for Mitigation of Onchain Exploits'' (Submitted to ISSTA 2026).



I am a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). My research focuses on **Large Language Models, Autonomous Agents, Reasoning, and Long-Context Algorithms**.

**Research Philosophy:** I strive to vertically integrate high-level agentic capabilities with low-level algorithmic innovations, treating model architecture and agent frameworks as unified means to realize scalable and capable AI.

Previously, I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (ACM Honors Class).
