#     Authors: Hongxin Zhang*, Weihua Du*, Jiaming Shan, Qinhong Zhou, Yilun Du, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Tianmin Shu, Chuang Gan.
#     We propose CoELA, a decentralized multi-agent system that uses GPT-4's language abilities for effective cooperation in complex tasks. CoELA combines reasoning and communication skills with perception and memory, outperforming traditional methods. It shows enhanced cooperation with humans and potential for future multi-agent research.

#     Authors: Andi Peng*, Weihua Du*, Jiaming Shan*, Tianmin Shu, Chuang Gan
#     CVPR, 2024 (Conference Submission)
#     We propose CHAIC, a 3D realistic challenge testing human-AI coordination where an AI helps a physically constrained human in household tasks. It focuses on AI‘s ability to understand tasks through observation, identify human constraints, and collaborate effectively. Using the TDW-Constrained simulator, it offers seven tasks for evaluating AI's social interaction and intelligence.

#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

I'm a CS PhD student in UCSB, advised by Prof. Yu Feng. My current research topic is Programming Language and Formal Verification. 
Now I'm working on projects that is related to 
- AI for math.
- smart contracts 

I'm also interested in AI, including training, embodied agents, etc.

Previously, I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University ACM class, doing research about embodied AI and Foundation Models.

  - We introduce Constrained Human-AI Cooperation (CHAIC), an embodied AI challenge centered on social intelligence. Agents must infer human intent and constraints and cooperatively assist with everyday tasks. Our benchmark features new constrained human agents and diverse, long-horizon indoor/outdoor scenarios. We evaluate baselines and propose a new LLM-based method, demonstrating CHAIC's effectiveness in assessing machine social intelligence.
